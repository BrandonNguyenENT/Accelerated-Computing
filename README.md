COMPE596: Advanced Computer Engineering Topics
Spring 2026 Topic: Accelerated Computing

Modern developments in computer engineering.

Use of hardware accelerators and parallel programming patterns to decrease the runtime of computationally demanding regions in software used in numerical scientific and engineering simulations and machine- and deep-learning frameworks. Parallel programming techniques to target execution on processors with many computation cores.  Methods to efficiently map computations to parallel hardware using specialized data structures and parallel algorithm paradigms. Design and deployment of kernels on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Data Processing Units (DPUs), data center scale Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), programmable network interface controllers (SmartNICs), programmable ASICs, and protocol-independent switch architectures (PISAs). Programming with the Nvidia CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) API, OpenCL (Open Computing Language) framework, OpenMP, Message Passing Interface (MPI) API, and the P4 language. Application case studies will focus on developing parallel solutions to numerical partial and stiff ordinary differential equations.
